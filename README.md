## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS


### What I learned

How to display an image properly and manage with `background`, `z-index` and `position`.

Validate a `form` or not with `if(!myForm[0].validity.valid)` and send a proper message error. 


### Continued development

Learning from each challenge, I will continue to make website with JS and learning from different challenge from Front-end Mentor.
